# LPP
lpp is a java package consisting of a class to solve continuous-space linear programming problems by the simplex method.

This simplex algorithm used is based on the one presented in [An Introduction to Linear Programming and Game Theory](https://www.wiley-vch.de/publish/en/books/newTitles200808/0-470-23286-2/description/?sID=lcezeae3m3tsuadl7kte2852zq) by Paul Thie and Gerard E. Keough.

A previous incarnation of this project, packaged in a GUI and compiled jar can downloaded at http://code.google.com/l/lpsolver
